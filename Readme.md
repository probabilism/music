Pica-perfect engravings of freely playable and performable sheet-music for your gratification, fingers, ears and soul.

## File Formats

Scores in this repository have been typeset with [MuseScore 3](https://musescore.org/) which is free, [open source](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore) software released under the *GPL version 2*; `.mscz` files are included, should you wish to modify or otherwise manipulate them therein.

Additionally, imminently printable `.pdf` files (DIN A4) are also included for convenience. While these are not readily editable, they are vector-based and ideal for easy printing.

The `.mscz` and `.pdf` files for a score will have matching names. The latter will be present for all scores for which the engraving and typesetting work has been completed to a satisfactory standard.

### Previews

## Feedback, Errata & Style

If you find any errors or omissions or have any input that might improve this content, *please* do not hesitate to [file an *issue* here, on this GitHub repository](https://github.com/probabilism/music/issues), so that the scores and other material may be corrected or enhanced for the benefit of all.

- Fingering solutions, musical embellishments and other subjective choices may be debated and, given motivating arguments, adopted.

### A Note on Fingerings

I am neither a professional pianist nor a piano instructor; I am not a music teacher or musical educator. The fingerings to be found on these scores should be considered neither authoritative nor recommended. Use them at your discretion.

Should you *be* a professional, instructor, educator, teacher or simply better at solving fingering puzzles than I, *please* contribute suggestions, corrections and improvements for the benefit of everybody by [opening an *issue* here, in GitHub](https://github.com/probabilism/music/issues).

Should you merely wish to eradicate the fingering hints from the sheets, download and install [MuseScore 3](https://musescore.org/) (it is free, [open source](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore) software) and follow the simple recipe, below:

0. Download the scores you wish to modify as `.mscz` files and open them in [MuseScore 3](https://musescore.org/).
1. Click on *any* fingering hint to select it.
2. *Right-click* on the selected fingering hint.
   - From the context menu that appears, choose **Select** → **All Similar Elements**.
   - All fingering hints in the entire document should then be selected.
3. Press *delete* to delete all the fingering hints.
   - Once done, you may proceed to print the score, export it as `.pdf`, or continue to manipulate it at your leasure.
